# processed-data

This folder contains data that has been processed and cleaned by code.

Any files located in here are based on the raw data and can be re-created running the various processing/cleaning code scripts in the `code` folder.

You could add a codebook here, but you could also just provide enough comments in the code that produces the content in this folder for users to understand what is saved in this location.
