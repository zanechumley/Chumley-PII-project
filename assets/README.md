# Assets

This folder should contain all static content from outside sources which is
neither code nor generated by code. This includes, but is not limited to,
schematics generated from biorender, other images taken from outside sources,
`csl` files, `bib` files, pdf files of references, etc.

As needed, this can be organized further. For instance one could have separate folders for references or figures (again, not figures generated by code, only manually created figures, e.g. conceptual/schematic drawings).
