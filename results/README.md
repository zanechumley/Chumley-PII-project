# results

This folder and subfolders contain results produced by the code, such as figures and tables, and other files.

A special folder for large files exists. This folder is set in .gitignore to be ignored when pushing/pulling. See the readme in that folder for details.

Structure the folders inside `results` such that they make sense for your specific analysis. Provide enough documentation that someone can understand what you are doing and what goes where. `readme.md` files inside each folder are a good idea.
