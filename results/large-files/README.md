# large-files

This is where you should store the results of computations that produce
large files, such as posterior samples from Bayesian models.

Folder for any large files that are too big to be tracked with GitHub.
That's generally anything above around 20MB. 

This folder is set in `.gitignore` to be ignored when pushing/pulling. (The folder itself and the readme will be synced, but all other files will be ignored.)

This allows large files to be part of the project. If you want to collaborate with someone or work on multiple computers, you need to manually share/transfer everything in this folder, e.g. by Dropbox/OneDrive/etc.

If you use a cloud service, you should add the link to the storage location and instructions for obtaining access below.
