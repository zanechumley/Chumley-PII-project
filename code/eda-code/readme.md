# eda-code

This folder contains code to do a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder.

It's the same code done 3 times. For explanations on the 3 different ways, see the readme file in the `processing-code` folder.
